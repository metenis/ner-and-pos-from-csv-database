## Project Overview

This project implements an automated **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** pipeline designed to analyze BBC News headlines. 

Using **Pandas** for data manipulation and **spaCy** for linguistic processing, the script extracts high-value features from raw text, specifically identifying **Named Entities** (people, organizations, locations) and grammatical **Part-of-Speech (POS)** tags.

## Key Features

* **Data Ingestion:** Efficiently loads and processes raw CSV datasets.
* **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Detects real-world objects in the text (e.g., identifying "London" as a location or "Google" as an organization).
* **Part-of-Speech Tagging (POS):** Analyzes sentence structure by tagging words as nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.
* **Vectorized Operations:** Uses Pandas `.apply()` for optimized performance on large datasets.
* **Statistical Summary:** Automatically calculates and displays the top extracted entities.
